# Tahoe: Tree Structure-Aware High Performance Inference Engine for Decision Tree Ensemble on GPU
Tahoe enables high-performance GPU inference for decision tree ensemble which can be used in high performance computing, advertising systems, medical diagnosis, financial fraud detection, etc.

# If you want to train the model from scratch
Please refer to our another repo: https://github.com/zhen-xie/Decision-tree-ensemble.git
```

## Build/Install from Source
```
git clone https://github.com/zhen-xie/Tahoe.git
cd Tahoe;
Modify the cub path in the Makefile to the correct path, such as "/home/cc/Tahoe/cub-1.8.0" in our Makefile
make Tahoe;
```

## Run an example
```
# Run Tahoe with the corresponding paths. The first parameter is the model path, and the second parameter is the data path.
./Tahoe [PATH_MODEL] [PATH_DATASET]
```

## Output
```
[zxie10@gpu050 Tahoe]$ ./Tahoe /home/zxie10/Project1/model_SUSY.txt /home/zxie10/Project1/data_SUSY.txt;

```

## Tahoe also provides a C++ interface to load forest and data from files and computes the prediction on GPU:
```C++
# Setup input forest, dataset, and algorithm, and construct the interface of Tahoe framework
BaseTahoeTest* pTest = new BaseTahoeTest(argv[1], argv[2]);
# Launch the inference of tree traversal
pTest->SetUp();
# Free resources
pTest->Free();
```
